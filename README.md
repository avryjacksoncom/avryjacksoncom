## Current Projects
[Project Notes](https://avryjacksoncom.github.io/)

### [Furry AI Google Calendar](https://github.com/avryjacksoncom/FurryCalendarApiRepo) | https://furryus.com/
- Building a website that automatically scrapes real- ife furry events and uses AI to extract event details.
which are then added to a shared Google Calendar. This project makes it easier for people to stay informed
and helps event organizers by automating the process of adding events to a calendar.

### Jewelry Exchange In-Store Customer Survey
- Created a survey to collect data on how customers discovered our store, helping us evaluate the
effectiveness of our advertising channels such as Google, Bing, etc.

### College Location Project
- Currently developing an enhanced Google Map for our college to provide detailed information
and more accurate directions. This will be my main development focus over the summer.

### Kitchen Scanner
- Developing a Kitchen Scanner App for personal use, with the goal of making it scalable.
Any 1D barcode scanner can be used so users can scan food items and retrieve product information
by scraping data from a UPC database.
