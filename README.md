## Current Projects
[Project Notes](https://avryjacksoncom.github.io/)

### [SoCalFurs.com ‚Äì Community Event Platform](https://socalfurs.com/)
https://github.com/avryjacksoncom/FurryCalendarApiRepo
- I developed an AI-powered event automation tool using Python, Google AI, and React that converts Telegram messages
into structured Google Calendar events. The system currently serves a community of over 2,000+ members with
80 organizers, handling hundreds of daily requests and syncing updates every three minutes to ensure real-time accuracy.
To improve accessibility, I also deployed a companion website for browsing and searching events.


### Jewelry Exchange In-Store Customer Survey
-At Jewelry Exchange, I automated duplicate detection in a 12,000+ image directory using Python, successfully
removing more than 200 redundant files. I also designed and deployed an HTML/JavaScript image carousel that improved
site engagement and contributed to a 20% increase in online sales. Developed a FastAPI and React-based customer survey
system that collects ad-source data from in-store visitors via QR code, averaging 25+ responses each weekend and
providing valuable marketing insights.

### College Location Project
-Building an interactive mapping platform with React and Python that helps students navigate campus buildings
and classrooms. The platform includes an admin-edit mode that allows administrators to add or edit buildings, paths,
and points of interest without code changes, and it is expected to support over 15,000 students and staff at
California State University, Dominguez Hills.
