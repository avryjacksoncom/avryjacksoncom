### Current Projects
[Project Notes](https://avryjacksoncom.github.io/)

### Furry AI Google Calendar | https://furryus.com/
- Scraping real life furry events and using AI to extrsact data to a google calendar. I've been making a
website with the google calendar for easier access to all. To anyone that has an interest in the fandom.
- My first programming project that helps people, and I'm really happy that I can help the oragnizers of
these events save their own time not having to add events manually to the calendar.

### Jewelry Excange In-Store Customer Survey
- Made a survey for data collecting on how a customer has heard of our store. To find out if our ads are working
from Google, Bing, etc, from real people.
- My second programming projcet being used in real life! This one was
interesting because it was more about understanding http to https traffic then actual code. I learned about vps
servers and pointing an ip to a domain.

### College Location Project
- Developing a google map for our college. More information and more direct directions.
I'll be trying to develop this one the most for this summer.

### Kitchen Scanner
- Developing a Kitchen Scanner App for my own home. Goal is that it can be scalable to other people as will.
I have integrated a barcode scanner so a user can scan a food item and it will scrape data from
a upc site to give inormation about the food product.
